# Advanced Urban Rappelling

Created by Tirpitz & Duda w/ custom animations by Mcruppert

**Features:**


 -Items:
 
    - rappelling anchor
    - Belay device
    - Ropes
    - TCX Force powered ascender device
    
 - Fire while rappelling! You can switch between your rifle and pistol while rappelling.
 - Custom animations and sounds
 - Supports swinging side to side, pushing off wall, and climbing back to the top.
 - ~~Supports rappelling AI units.~~ Currently not functional with the new mechanics.
 - ~~Can be installed as server-side only addon. However, clients without the addon won't be able to shoot while rappelling and won't see custom animations and sounds. Still looks great though!~~
 - SP and MP compatible.

**Directions:**

 - Place rappelling anchor.
 - Prapare ropes.
 - Place a rappelling point (near the top of the rappelling route).
 - Tie in to the rappelling rope.
 - you can also tie in from the other end of the rope
 - once complete you can pick up the rappel point and pack up the rope again, the rappelling anchor cannot be reused.

Once rappelling, here's what you can do:

 - Move down rope (use move backwards key: s)
 - Move up rope (use move forwards key: w)
 - Wall walk left (use move left key: a) - must be facing & against surface to walk.
 - Wall walk right (use move right key: d) - must be facing & against surface to walk.
 - Push off wall (use sprint key: left shift) - must be facing & against surface to push off.
 - Push off wall more (hold down sprint key & release: left shift) - must be facing & against surface to push off.
 - Take out weapon (use fire: left mouse click or raise weapon key: left ctrl twice)
 - Lower weapon (use lower weapon key: left ctrl twice)
 - Switch weapon (use your action menu to select rifle or pistol)
 - Climb back to top (move up rope to the top, and then use action menu)
 - Detach from rope (use action menu)


**Installation:**

 1. Subscribe via steam: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2378849207 or download latest release from https://github.com/Tirpitz93/AdvancedUrbanRappelling
 2. If installing this on a server, add the addon to the -serverMod command line option. It's required on the server side and is optional for clients. It's recommended to put the addon's key in your server's key directory so clients can optionally enable the addon. If clients have the addon enabled, they'll be able to shoot while rappelling and will have custom animations and sounds.


**Not working on your server?**

Make sure you have the mod listed in the -mod or -serverMod command line option. Only -serverMod is required for this addon. If still not working, check your server log to make sure the addon is found. 

**FAQ**

*This addon is only required on the server - is it going to slow down my server?*

No - while this addon is server-side only, it installs itself on all clients without them downloading the addon. Most of the time, the rappelling code actually runs client-side, even though you installed the addon only on the server. Magic! 

*Battleye kicks me when I try to do xyz. What do I do?*

You need to configure Battleye rules on your server. Below are the files you need to configure: 

setvariable.txt 

Add the following exclusions to the end of all lines starting with 4, 5, 6, or 7 if they contain "" (meaning applies to all values): 

!"AUR_"
!"TIRP_"

setvariableval.txt 

If you have any lines starting with 4, 5, 6, or 7 and they contain "" (meaning applies to all values) it's not going to work. Either remove the line or explicitly define the values you want to kick. Since the values of the variables above can vary, I don't know of a good way to define an exclusion rule. 

Also, it's possible there are other battleye filter files that can cause issues. If you check your battleye logs you can figure out which file is causing a problem.

*The rappelling action appears while in a heli, but do nothing when I select them. How do I fix that?*

Most likely your server is setup with a white list for remote executions. In order to fix this, you need to modify your mission's description.ext file, adding the following CfgRemoteExec rules. If using InfiStar you should edit your cfgremoteexec.hpp instead of the description.ext file. See https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Remote_Execution for more details on CfgRemoteExec.
	
```
class CfgRemoteExec
{
	class Functions
	{
		class AUR_Hint { allowedTargets=1; }; 
		class AUR_Hide_Object_Global { allowedTargets=2; }; 
		class AUR_Enable_Rappelling_Animation_Global { allowedTargets=2; }; 
		class AUR_Play_Rappelling_Sounds_Global { allowedTargets=2; }; 
	};
};
```
